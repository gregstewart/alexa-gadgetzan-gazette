<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	Class changes related to the latest build of Patch 7.1.5.
</p>

<p>
	Not all class changes can be viewed via datamining. In order to make up for various nerfs, sometimes, Blizzard decides to buff a an entire specialization. This is done via Auras and specialization auras will increase the damage output of <u>several abilities at once</u> which makes tuning easier. For example in the latest Build 23244, some Legendary items have been nerfed and we've also got some class changes. To make up for all that, some specializations have seen a flat % increase to all damage/healing done.

	Our guide section has been updated to include Ragnaros, the Firelord!
</p>

<p>
	<a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/profile/25746-oxygen/" rel="">Oxy</a> has been busy writing our <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/heroes/ragnaros-build-guide" rel="external nofollow">Ragnaros Build Guide</a> and it features three builds.
</p>

<p>
	A) <strong>Blast Wave Build</strong> - revolves around his Blast Wave ability, but is heavily reliant on proper positioning.
</p>

<p>
	B) <strong>Living Meteor Build</strong> - empowers LM to deal a lot of damage from afar.
</p>

<p>
	C) <strong>Empowered Sulfuras Build</strong> - improves his Q that's the source of his sustained damage, requires melee range.

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	A quick gold making method that requires very little work. You only need to have the Obliterum Forge unlocked. It has no reputation requirements.
</p>

<p>
	Check out your realm's current price of <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Obliterum" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_obliterum_chunk.jpg"><a class="q4" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=124125" rel="external nofollow">Obliterum</a></span>. My realm is at 1,700 Gold / piece (<a href="https://theunderminejournal.com/#us/illidan/item/124125" rel="external nofollow">Source</a>).

<p>
	Sometimes you may add cheap crafted JWC amulets to the list such as <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Ancient Maelstrom Amulet" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_jewelcrafting_70_maxlvlneck_blue.jpg"><a class="q3" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=130241" rel="external nofollow">Ancient Maelstrom Amulet</a></span><span class="spell_icon_span">, <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Subtle Shadowruby Pendant" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_jewelcrafting_70_maxlvlneck_purple.jpg"><a class="q3" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=130236" rel="external nofollow">Subtle Shadowruby Pendant</a></span></span> or <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Blessed Dawnlight Medallion" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_jewelcrafting_70_maxlvlneck_yellow.jpg"><a class="q3" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=130234" rel="external nofollow">Blessed Dawnlight Medallion</a></span> if they can be bought for a reasonable price. I recommend checking out <a href="https://theunderminejournal.com/#us/illidan/category/jewelcrafting" rel="external nofollow">your realm's TuJ's Jewelcrafting page</a> for prices of 0/7 amulets. They pop up for 2K / piece once in a while.
</p>

<p>
	I buy everything below 2,000 Gold. Most of the time, I will buy <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Infernal Alchemist Stone" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_alchemy_70_trinket.jpg"><a class="q3" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=127842" rel="external nofollow">Infernal Alchemist Stone</a></span> for anywhere between 1,700 - 1,900 Gold and on average get 150 <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Obliterum Ash" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_obliterum_ash.jpg"><a class="q4" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=136342" rel="external nofollow">Obliterum Ash</a></span>. All the enchants can be bought up to 2,000 Gold / piece and most of the time I get anywhere between 130-140 <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Obliterum Ash" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_obliterum_ash.jpg"><a class="q4" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=136342" rel="external nofollow">Obliterum Ash</a></span>. Destroy all the items and resell as <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Obliterum" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_obliterum_chunk.jpg"><a class="q4" href="http://www.wowhead.com/item=124125" rel="external nofollow">Obliterum</a></span>. It's good to sell at different stacks. Stacks of 8 work very well and sell instantly.

	Timewalking is one of those great ideas that was implemented and is just begging to be expanded to raids as well as dungeons, but until that happens at least we're getting some more old 5 mans to enjoy with the addition of MoP to the Timewalking roster!<br><br>
	You can also check out our own preview of the new additions <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/25934-patch-715-mists-of-pandaria-timewalking/" rel="">here</a>.

			<article class="detail"><p>
					In patch 7.1.5, you’ll get to join the denizens of Azeroth in a new journey back in time to the days of the lifting of the mists—Timewalking is coming to the islands of Pandaria.
				</p>

				<p>
					For players at level 91 and higher, this means a new Bonus Event every few weeks that operates very much like other Timewalking Bonus Events to Outland, Northrend, and Cataclysm.
				</p>

				<p style="margin-left:.25in;">
					 
				</p>

				<h4>
					<strong>A Return to Pandaria</strong>
				</h4>

				<p>
					When you queue up for this new round of Timewalking, you’ll find yourself heading into:
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						<strong>Temple of the Jade Serpent</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="center">
					<div class="image">

</div>
				</div>

				<p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">
					<em>Rising high above the east coast of Pandaria, the Temple of the Jade Serpent stands as a sacred monument to the legendary pandaren emperor Shaohao's victory over the Sha of Doubt thousands of years ago. Recently, a disastrous conflict in the Jade Forest unleashed the sha, and several of the entities have raided the temple's most treasured stores of wisdom and knowledge.</em>
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						<strong>Stormstout Brewery</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="center">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_folder_media/MA6OL3IYR39Y1481332152772.jpg" alt="MA6OL3IYR39Y1481332152772.jpg">

				</div>

				<p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">
					<em>When Chen Stormstout arrived in the Valley of the Four Winds, he journeyed to the renowned brewery of his namesake, hoping to connect with his relatives. What he found was his ancestral home in disarray. Under the watch of the incompetent Uncle Gao, loathsome virmen and unruly hozen have infiltrated the brewery, sparking a destructive revel that will soon devastate the region's supply of tasty brews.</em>
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						<strong>Shado-Pan Monastery</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="center">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_folder_media/UWL3VYBPAK5X1481332152591.jpg" alt="UWL3VYBPAK5X1481332152591.jpg">
</div>
				</div>

				<p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">
					<em>War has spread across Pandaria, and the destructive conflict between the Horde and Alliance has led to turmoil in the majestic Shado-Pan Monastery. There, three malevolent entities--the Sha of Violence, the Sha of Hatred, and the Sha of Anger--have erupted from their prisons. Although the Sha of Anger fled the secluded monastery completely, the remaining sha have begun wreaking havoc on the site's brave Shado-Pan defenders.</em>
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						<strong>Mogu’shan Palace</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="center">
					<div class="image">

</div>
				</div>

				<p style="margin-left:.75in;">
					<em>The ancient Mogu'shan Palace is the last true bastion of mogu strength on mainland Pandaria. Three of their great clans recently gathered at this stunning location to meet with their king, Xin the Weaponmaster. This mighty ruler has formulated a bold plan to unite his scattered people and reclaim the glory of their fallen empire. With turmoil gripping Pandaria, Xin's lofty dream of conquest could become reality.</em>
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						<strong>Siege of Niuzao Temple</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="center">
					<div class="image">
						<img src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/content_folder_media/M6KXQ2Q0BRGB1481332152765.jpg" alt="M6KXQ2Q0BRGB1481332152765.jpg">
</div>
				</div>

				<p style="margin-left:.75in;">
					<em>Niuzao Temple extends across two fortified islands far beyond a towering wall called the Serpent's Spine. For years, tenacious pandaren defenders have protected the narrow bridges connecting the isles, staving off any would-be invaders. Yet recently, the mantid created their own bridge--a massive tree root--and seized one of the islands by surprise. Now, these brutal insectoids are poised to assault Niuzao's remaining guardians.</em>
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						<strong>Gate of the Setting Sun</strong>
					</li>
				</ul>
<div class="center">
					<div class="image">

</div>
				</div>

				<p style="margin-left: 0.75in;">
					<em>For generations, a massive wall called the Serpent's Spine has protected the denizens of Pandaria from periodic assaults by the rampaging, insect-like mantid. This brutal race's cycle of aggression recently began earlier than expected, catching the wall's defenders off guard. As the mightiest mantid warriors charge the battle-worn gates, Pandaria must hold back the most devastating army in the land's recorded history.</em>
				</p>

				<h4>
					<strong>Timeless Rewards</strong>
				</h4>

				<p>
					There’s a new Timewalking Vendor on the Timeless Isle. Mistweaver Xia is waiting to take your hard earned Timewarped Badges in exchange for all sorts of wondrous rewards:
				</p>

				<ul>
<li>
						Reins of the Heavenly Jade Cloud Serpent (Yu’lei, Daughter of Jade mount)
					</li>
					<li>
						2 new pets—Infinite Hatchling (dragonkin) and Paradox Spirit (aquatic)
					</li>
					<li>
						Reputation Tokens for all major Pandaria factions and friendship items
					</li>
					<li>
						2 new Toys—Adopted Puppy Crate and Portable Yak Wash
					</li>
					<li>
						Chilled Satchel of Vegetables, to help chefs who've missed out on Pandaren cuisine
					</li>
					<li>
						Updated equipment selections from Pandaria factions
					</li>
				</ul>
<p>
					That’s right-- this will be the first Timewalking Bonus Event to include pets as rewards. Both of the new pets have a new ability for pet battles: <em>Temporal Anomaly</em>, which significantly reduces the speed of the enemy team.
				</p>

				<p>
					You won’t want to miss this opportunity to earn valuable reputation with Pandaria factions while challenging dungeons. Every Mists of Pandaria faction holds handsome rewards for players who maximize reputation with them. For example, you’ll be able to obtain Commendations for Emperor Shaohao from Mistweaver Xia, which could lead to a Heavenly Golden Cloud Serpent (mount) or Celestial Defender’s Medallion (toy) for you. If you haven’t yet maximized your rep with Golden Lotus, there are Riding Crane mounts in your future!
				</p>

				<h4>
					<strong>You’ve Got Scaled</strong>
				</h4>

				<p>
					As with other Timewalking Bonus events, when you queue up for Pandaria dungeons, your power and defenses will be scaled down to appropriate levels for those dungeons on Heroic difficulty. When you defeat bosses in Mists of Pandaria Timewalking, you’ll receive loot that scales with your level, up to item level 830—perfect for characters who are gearing up in Legion dungeons.
				</p>

				<p>
					Encounters such as Yan-Zhu the Uncasked in Stormstout Brewery or Taran Zhu in Shado-Pan Monastery will once again put you and your party to the test.
				</p>

				<p>
					We can’t wait to see you there!

	<img alt="aHd6paz.png" data-icy-veins="news_image" data-ipb="nomediaparse" src="http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/news/26812-tavern-brawl-the-battle-for-gadgetzan.png"></p>

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	This week's Tavern Brawl is called The Battle for Gadgetzan. It is the seventy ninth Tavern Brawl.
</p>

<p>
	The Brawl is played with one of three classes. Druid, Paladin, or Priest. The class you play is decided randomly at the beginning of the game. Your deck is a prebuilt deck that lasts the duration of the game, you do not have to use your own cards, and it is not possible to play someone of the same class.
</p>

<p>
	At the start of the Brawl, you are announced by your gang name, not your class. During the Brawl, the leader of the factions being represented will pop up and chat from time to time. If you win the game, you will complete quests of any class in the faction you represented.
</p>

<p>
	Overall, I like this Brawl. It gives players a chance to play decent constructed decks with the new cards, and see which factions they like the style of. Although it won't appeal much to serious players, I feel that in general, the Brawls should aim lower than that, and this one does a good job.
</p>

<p>
	I won't spoil the deck lists for the Brawl, but the Priest deck is Dragon Priest, the Paladin deck is full of buffs, and the Druid deck is full of Jade Golems. All three decks require understanding of fundamental Hearthstone principles, and it seems at first look that the better player has a reasonable advantage, no matter which deck they are given.

		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>Developer Comments</em></span>:  The goals with this Artanis update were twofold: Increase his playmaking (swapping enemies during Blade Dash), and increase his solo lane capabilities (Blade Dash reduces Shield Overload cooldown, Shield Overload triggers at higher Health). We think that with these changes, Artanis will be a strong choice on a lot more Battlegrounds and with more team compositions.

<blockquote>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>Developer Comments</em></span>:  We started doing some small changes to Dehaka’s talent tree in order to increase diversity and fix some talent pick issues. As is par for the course, this opened a rabbit-hole of design opportunities that we ended up falling into. While Dehaka’s changes were mostly complete before the BlizzCon Finals, his resurgence as a dark horse of competitive play helped us narrow down and finalize the rework. Base movement speed on Brushstalker helps meld his design while some brand new talents should open up some fun new ways to hunt your prey.

<blockquote>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>Developer Comments</em></span>:  The Lord of Terror has been under the knife for a couple months and has finally collected enough souls to resurrect himself. He reenters the Nexus with an updated talent tree focusing on maintaining and amplifying his identity. He should still excel as a gank-oriented Warrior, punishing out-of-position enemies, but also brings along some new survivability options. While we had to lower his damage slightly, the baseline addition of Firestorm and larger payoff for Shadow Charging enemies into collision should heavily reward opportunistic Diablo players.

	Our micro-holiday preview continues with Un'Goro Madness that's scheduled for August 10.

	<strong>Unholy Death Knights</strong>

<p>
	A small buff is coming to Unholy Death Knights in a future PTR build. The newest build should also feature a <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/26784-substantial-legendary-changes-coming-to-ptr/" rel="">major rework of many Legendary items</a>.

However, the damage of the summoned ghouls will be increased by 33% (which will not be obvious from data), keeping the total the same. This is also a large buff to the damage of <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Army of the Dead" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/spell_deathknight_armyofthedead.jpg"><a class="spell" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/42650" rel="external nofollow">Army of the Dead</a></span>.

</p>

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	It seems there will be some major changes coming to legendaries in the next PTR build, including nerfs to the more powerful and "always useful ones" as well as buffs to situational ones:
</p>

<div class="blue_post">
	<h2 class="blue_title">
		<img alt="Blizzard Logo" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/images/common/blizzard_icon.png">Lore (<a href="https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752626046" rel="external nofollow">source</a>)
	</h2>

	<p>
		As we mentioned this during the live Q&amp;A last week, we feel the biggest shortcoming of the current Legendary system is that, for some specs, there are some items that are clearly better than others in nearly all situations. As a result, players who have received a different Legendary item feel unlucky, as they didn’t receive the “best” one.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, we’re making some fairly substantial changes to Legendary items intended to bring them more in line with each other. Items that give a raw throughput increase (without significant situational restrictions or drawbacks) are having their overall power reduced, and we’re taking another pass at several of the more niche items to make sure that, when they’re usable, they feel powerful.
	</p>

	<p>
		Essentially, we feel that if a Legendary is only usable in certain situations, it should feel extremely valuable in those situations. Conversely, if a Legendary is nearly always going to increase your overall performance, that increase should be relatively smaller. Up until this point, we’ve made the mistake of allowing several items to be both extremely impactful AND always useful, which has made other Legendaries feel “bad” by comparison. It’s also caused some specs to feel as though they need a particular Legendary in order to compete. Those are the issues we’d like to solve.
	</p>

	<p>
		We’re actively working on these changes right now and expect to have them ready for the next PTR build. We’ll be doing additional class tuning where necessary as a followup, once these changes are in place.
	</p>

	<div>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>Instead we are faced with the daunting possibility that we may simply never get a useful legendary. That is not fun, its repeatedly disappointing.</em></span>
	</div>

	<div>
		We agree. The problem is that some Legendaries don't feel useful. That's the issue we're looking to solve here.
	</div>

	<div>
		 
	</div>

	<div>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>I really hope you guys learn from the system and the next iteration of legendaries is purely defensive/utility and no outright dps legendary affixes. They would be much more fair/balanced if they were that way.</em></span>
	</div>

	<div>
		There's definitely a lot we've learned here. Ion even said pretty much exactly this in the last Q&amp;A - if we did it all over again, we'd probably only make "Utility" Legendaries.
	</div>

	<div>
		<div>
			 
		</div>

		<div>
			<span style="color:#ffffff;">With some, as </span><span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="The Instructor's Fourth Lesson" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_bracer_26b.jpg"><a class="q5" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/132448" rel="external nofollow">The Instructor's Fourth Lesson</a></span><span style="color:#ffffff;"> for Unholy DKs, it is MANDATORY. This legendary is -required- for us to perform even remotely on par with other DPS classes.</span>
		</div>

		<div>
			Right. As I said, that's another problem we're trying to fix. If a spec is only competitive with a specific Legendary, then we need to bring up their numbers. To do that, we need to also nerf that Legendary.
		</div>

		<div>
			 
		</div>

		<div>
			<div>
				<em><span style="color:#ffffff;">Just use a legendary token system. Problem solved.</span></em>
			</div>

			<div>
				Disagree. "Just let me pick the best Legendary" doesn't solve this particular problem; there shouldn't be one or two Legendaries that are far and away the best one in all situations. With the way these items are in 7.1, if we add such a system, everyone will just pick the best 2 for their spec and the rest will still suck. We'd rather that none of them sucked.<br><br>
				And just to be clear: something like what you (and others) are describing here is not off the table. Ion even mentioned at BlizzCon that we may end up doing something along those lines in a later patch. It just doesn't solve this problem.
			</div>

			<div>
				 
			</div>

			<div>
				<div>
					<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>Another problem not mentioned here is being spec-locked because of legendaries. I have X on my spec, so can't freely switch without feeling behind. AP already contributes to this problem but at least can be caught up -- legendaries, with soft caps and what not, just make it impossible to switch.</em></span>
				</div>

				<div>
					 
				</div>

				<div>
					Yeah, we definitely share your concern here. We don't have a solution yet (and aren't likely to for 7.1.5), but it's something we're talking about.
				</div>

		It's the most wonderful time of the year, and we hope you'll join us for some holiday cheer!
	</p>

	<p>
		That's right—Overwatch is getting into the holiday spirit with a brand-new seasonal event. We’ve decked the halls of Hanamura and King’s Row, stuffed our Loot Boxes full of festive goodies, and arranged an extra-special snowball fight for you and your friends. So, grab a mug of hot cocoa, put on your favorite ugly sweater, and get ready to jingle all the way to <strong>Overwatch's</strong> <strong>Winter Wonderland</strong>!

		Starting today, all in-game Loot Boxes have been replaced with our impeccably wrapped <strong>Winter Loot Boxes</strong>, and they’re filled to the brim with over 100 new cosmetic trimmings!
	</p>

	<p>
		As with previous events, Winter Loot Boxes can be earned or purchased, and each will contain at least one item from our 2016 Winter Wonderland collection—including profile icons, sprays, victory poses, emotes, highlight intros, skins, and more! While the contents of each seasonal Loot Box are random, you can unlock a variety of these cordial customization options in the Hero Gallery throughout the event’s duration.

	<p>
		Once you've unlocked an item, it will be yours forever, which means you can get into holly jolly hijinks all year-round. The collection will be dashing back into the vault on <strong>January 2</strong>, however (when the event concludes), so be sure to fire up your favorite gaming machine and celebrate before it’s too late!

		During this year’s Winter Wonderland event, you’ll also be able to queue up for a brand new brawl: <strong>Mei’s Snowball Offensive</strong>! Mei’s Snowball Offensive is a 6v6, single-elimination shindig featuring everyone's favorite climatologist—and she's got a few new tricks up her fur-lined sleeve.
	</p>

	<p align="center">
		<img alt="MeisSnowballOffensiveCard_OW_JP.jpg" data-id="20401391" src="https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/page_media/8p/8PAM5214BPNI1481354390844.jpg"></p>

	<p>
		In this brawl, Mei's Endothermic Blaster no longer unleashes a stream of frost or shoots icicles. Instead, it's been modified to fire a single, super-powered snowball. Taking down an enemy only takes one hit, but a miss can be costly. Once your weapon is empty, your enemies will have the advantage as you search for the nearest snow pile to reload, so don't forget to cover your retreat with ice walls and cryo-freeze to block their attacks—and when the battle starts to heat up, you can activate Mei's Ultimate, which turns her blaster into a semi-automatic snowball launcher, allowing you to fire continuously as your enemies scatter.
	</p>

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	The Glowcap festival takes place in Zangarmarsh on May 25. You may remember <a class="faction" href="http://www.wowdb.com/factions/970" rel="external nofollow">Sporeggar</a> reputation from the Burning Crusade.
</p>

<p>
	<b>Description</b>
</p>

<p>
	<em>Today, the sporelings of Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh hold their annual mushroom festival. Help them keep the great Fshoo alive as long as possible!</em>
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Reaching Friendly</strong>
</p>

<p>
	All players start out with <em>Unfriendly </em>with Sporeggar and there are several ways to increase your reputation until you hit <em>Friendly</em>.
</p>

<p>
	The easiest way is to kill Bog Lords in the surrounding area and loot <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Bog Lord Tendril" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_misc_monstertail_03.jpg"><a class="q1" href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/24291" rel="external nofollow">Bog Lord Tendril</a></span> from them. Combine that with looting <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Mature Spore Sac" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_misc_organ_02.jpg"><a class="q1" href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/24290" rel="external nofollow">Mature Spore Sacs</a> and find</span> <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/17923" rel="external nofollow">Fahssn</a>.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="gaM9UHe.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/gaM9UHe.jpg"></p>

<p>
	He will offer you quests to turn in the items for reputation until <em>Friendly</em>.

<p>
	<strong>Glowcap Festival</strong>
</p>

<p>
	<a class="npc" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/118509" rel="external nofollow">Fshoo</a> will periodically spawn in the center of the village and it's your task to keep her alive as long as possible.

You can use bandages, healing spells and the mushroom items to keep her alive. Generally the best idea is to have healers stack <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Sporeggium" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_mushroom_11.jpg"><a class="q1" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144261" rel="external nofollow">Sporeggium</a></span> for increased healing and when they can't keep up, <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Rimecap" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_mushroom_10.jpg"><a class="q1" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144265" rel="external nofollow">Rimecap</a> and <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Fungal Lifestalk" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_misc_starspecklemushroom.jpg"><a class="q1" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/144262" rel="external nofollow">Fungal Lifestalk</a></span> should be used.</span>

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	Topics discussed today are reputation improvements for alts, fixes to tab targeting and communication standards.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>Reputation Improvements</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Patch 7.1 made dungeons gated behind the Nightfallen reputation account-wide. Players share their thoughts, mentioning the Pandaria reputation system as a solution to "the problem". If you haven't played during MoP, there were items such as <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Grand Commendation of the Shado-Pan" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/achievement_faction_shadopan.jpg"><a class="q7" href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/93220" rel="external nofollow">Grand Commendation of the Shado-Pan</a></span> that increased the reputation gain on your entire count with a faction once you've reached Revered. Lore mentioned this was discussed during Q&amp;A, but the developers need to know what "the problem" is before making any solutions. What are the items your alts need that are gated behind Legion faction reputation? Profession recipes? Wouldn't that just make professions less valuable if all your alts had access to them?
</p>

<div class="blue_post">
	<h2 class="blue_title">
		<img alt="Blizzard Logo" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/images/common/blizzard_icon.png">Lore
	</h2>

	<p>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>In Mists, we have an awesome system where you could send tokens that doubled the rep earned for alts. Im not asking more than that. Just something, the system even already exists.<br><br>
		Please, dont make alts more harder than it already is. (and rerolls too)</em></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		We talked about this idea briefly on the Q&amp;A the other day, but I'm interested in hearing more feedback. What do you feel you need access to that's locked behind a reputation for your alt? Most of the "big" unlocks - e.g. World Quests, access to Suramar dungeons - are now account-wide.
	</p>

	<p>
		So, let me clarify my thoughts a bit, and why I asked for specifics:<br><br>
		Quite often, we see feedback that focuses on the solution instead of the problem. That's not a bad thing (in fact, it's quite natural and in many ways polite for someone who's trying to be helpful to suggest a fix for a problem), it's just that it occasionally means we have trouble tracking down what the actual core issue is that's causing you to present that solution.<br><br>
		Looking specifically at this topic: many of you are suggesting the MoP-style rep tokens as "the right fix." And maybe it is! But if we were to implement something like that, we need to know what it's fixing, because we might have a better way to solve the same problem. Or maybe we don't see it as a problem at all.<br><br>
		To use a dumb analogy, because I love analogies: say your roof has a leak, and every time it rains, water drips down through your ceiling and your carpet gets wet. You could keep a pot nearby that you put under the drip when it rains - that'd certainly solve the issue of damp carpet - but it's kind of inconvenient, and the leak is still there. It'd be a much better solution to fix the roof, so the leak stops happening entirely.<br><br>
		Or, you know, maybe you're actually in a gazebo and the carpet is supposed to get wet because it's weather-resistant and... okay, so this analogy isn't perfect. But hopefully I at least illustrated why I asked for specifics: maybe the solution is that the thing you want via rep should just be account-wide. Maybe it's already supposed to be account-wide, but there's a bug. Or maybe having to gain the reputation on your alt is an intended part of playing a second character.<br><br>
		This is mostly just me musing - there's some great info in this thread already that we can definitely talk about - but I thought it might be interesting or helpful to clarify.

<p>
	<strong>Fixing Tab Targeting</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Tab targeting is definitely an issue in Legion and in Patch 7.1 it was reverted back to the same logic used in Warlords of Draenor. If you're experiencing any issues, there's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/59szd0/whats_going_on_with_tab_targeting_its_awful_since/" rel="external nofollow">an interesting thread about tab targeting on reddit</a>.
</p>

<div class="blue_post">
	<h2 class="blue_title">
		<img alt="Blizzard Logo" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/images/common/blizzard_icon.png">Lore
	</h2>

	<p>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>I know I am not alone in thinking how terrible tab targeting is in this expansion. And no, I don't think tab targeting is the best way to target in all situations, but it certainly is great to have a reliable version of tab targeting in many situations.<br><br>
		Why do we have to hit tab 3945828597109 times before the game finally gives in and (reluctantly) targets our intended target? Obviously that's exaggerated, but sometimes it does feel like it takes an eternity.<br><br>
		I took a break from the game starting in early WoD and came back shortly after the Legion launch, so I am not sure if this was an issue last xpac. But can we please have the MoP (and earlier xpacs) version of tab targeting? It used to be so much more efficient.</em></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		So, in 7.1, we actually reverted the tab targeting logic back to what it was prior to Patch 7.0. It should be functioning now exactly like it did during Warlords. I've personally found it much more reliable; if you're still having issues with it, did you have similar issues during Warlords?

<p>
	<strong>Standards of Communication</strong>
</p>

<p>
	Patch 7.1.5 brought a lot of class changes, but there were no words from the developers. With <a href="http://www.icy-veins.com/forums/topic/26453-patch-715-secondary-stats-tweaks/" rel="">tweaks to secondary stats</a>, players have found themselves less powerful than on live. Since then, PTR communication has been a great topic of concern. It was discussed during the last Q&amp;A that developers will be communicating more with the community regarding future changes, additions and more. We should expect the next Q&amp;A somewhere during the first weeks of January around the release of Patch 7.1.5. This posts talks about means of communication and feedback. Twitter character limitations are both a curse and a gift, live Q&amp;As aren't a good way to answer most of the questions and Lore admits the team's overall forum presence isn't the best and it's something they're trying to improve upon as a team. I entirely agree there should be more interviews. Do you think communication between developers and the community is more transparent in other games like HotS or Overwatch as opposed to WoW?

		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>On Twitter</strong></span>: Disagree that it's always the wrong approach, but it's definitely not always the right approach either. 140 characters is a blessing and a curse - it's harder to get a complete point across sometimes, yes, but it also forces things to be presented more concisely, which is great for certain types of feedback. We're not going to stop using Twitter, but we're continuing to learn about when it's not the right platform.<br><br>
		Also just as an aside, every account other than @WarcraftDevs should be treated as someone's personal account and not as the correct place to provide feedback or look for answers. That also means that it's completely their choice if they decide to mute or block someone. <br><br><span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>On the Q&amp;As</strong></span>: I agree that the experiment in the last one to answer more spec-specific questions didn't go well. I honestly don't think the live Q&amp;As are a good way to answer those questions at all. Even if we were to somehow narrow it down to only "legitimate" questions (aside: what criteria determine "legitimate" anyway?), there's far more to answer than we can possibly fit into one Q&amp;A, so we're always going to leave something out.<br><br>
		Secondly, it's important to remember that not everyone follows fansites closely, or saw the BlizzCon panels, or even the other Q&amp;As. AK alt catchup is a great example - despite all of the other places we talked about what's happening in 7.1.5, it was still one of the most-asked questions. I'm glad that you had already heard about it, but clearly a lot of others had not, which made it absolutely worth answering.<br><br>
		I do agree, though, that the Q&amp;As work best when we either stick to broader topics, or focus the entire thing specifically on one topic (like we did with the Professions, PvP, etc. Q&amp;As a few months ago). As a whole, it's a format we're still experimenting with. I can't promise they'll all be great, but I can promise that we'll learn from when they aren't.<br><br><span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>On Interviews</strong></span>: Mostly agree, although it depends on the interviewer. You're not likely to see the hard-hitting questions coming from a major gaming publication, but you might from a community site, podcast, etc. Personally, I actually think we need a lot more interviews with those community sites, especially those that focus on more niche playstyles - it's a great way to get answers to those people without "wasting" everyone else's time.<br><br><span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>On the forums</strong></span>: I actually completely agree with you here. Our forum presence sucks. It's a big issue that we're working to fix. That's part of why I'm here, posting this, and will continue to be around these forums as much as I can. Resolving this issue will take some time - if it can ever be completely resolved - but we're working on it.<br><br>
		It's worth mentioning that part of the issue - the general lack of dev posts - has been because they've been focusing as much of their time as possible into working on the game. Part of trying to keep patches coming at a good cadence means we need all hands on deck to get the work done, which means less time for the dev team to spend on the forums. That in turn means that, when the devs do get time for the forums, they spend the vast majority of it just reading, so they can absorb as much feedback as possible. So, the community team (including myself, but many others as well) need to step in to fill that gap, in a way that doesn't make you go "Ooh, a blue post! Ugh, it's just a CM." We haven't been, but we're going to.<br><br><span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>On Reddit</strong></span>: I also like AMAs, and agree with your thoughts here. I do think that there are some topics where they might work much better than the Q&amp;As, and while I don't want to say what those are for fear of over-promising, it's a cool idea that I'll circulate around.<br><br><span style="color:#ffffff;"><strong>On Patch Notes</strong></span>: I think a lot of the issues with patch notes are actually symptoms of some of the above issues. The designers' notes are definitely a good addition, but those are intended as little snippets of explanation for the player who doesn't really keep up with fansites, interviews, forums (well, when there's posts on them), etc. It shouldn't, whenever possible, be the first place that the person reading this thread heard about something, unless it really only needs a couple sentences to explain. If we need to give more detail, we should be doing that ahead of time and just referencing that explanation in the patch notes.<br><br>
		We've also heard loud and clear that you guys want PTR Patch Notes back. It's a tough situation for us to solve, though I don't think it's an unsolvable one. The PTR, especially under Legion's development structure, is much more experimental and incomplete than it's been in the past. Having official patch notes makes each individual change - any of which could be reverted at any point - feel a lot more "final" than they really are.<br><br>
		Our approach for 7.1.5, then, was "let's focus on what it'll be when it's done" - that was clearly the wrong choice. Official PTR Patch Notes might not be the answer we need, but we definitely need a way to keep you more informed of what's happening, especially for class changes. Even something as simple as "Class Notes for PTR Build ABCXYZ" might fill the gap.<br><br>
		At any rate, thanks for this - it's given us a lot to think about. I know there's a big difference between saying we'll do better and actually doing better, but threads like this really help us actually improve things.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>The one thing I should really say about this is the fact that you have ONE twitter account for EVERY form of feedback and question.<br><br>
		Why don't you like, delegate it out a bit? <br>
		@WarcraftDevs<br>
		@WarcraftHunters<br>
		@WarcraftDK<br>
		@WarcraftPvP<br>
		@WarcraftRaid<br>
		@warcraftdungeon<br>
		@warcraftuselessquestionsthatpeopleonGDforumsaskoverandoverandover<br>
		you get the idea</em></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		I think this would just get confusing really quickly, and lead directly into one of the issues the OP mentioned which is needing to follow too many channels at once.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>I have an idea for your Q&amp;A that should get you the questions that people want answered most<br><br>
		Make a thread about the Q&amp;A first and specifically state that the most upvoted questions in this thread will be adressed/responded to in the Q&amp;A when it happens. Do this everytime you have a Q&amp;A, that should help people get the questions they want to see and hopefully the answers they want to see</em></span><span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>.</em></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		We briefly debated this early on but decided against it, for a few reasons:<br><br>
		1) We don't always have an answer for something - if a highly-upvoted question is going to get "I don't know" or "We're not sure yet" as an answer, is that acceptable?<br><br>
		2) Sometimes the answer lies in something we're not ready to talk about yet; for example, if "When will you add Demon Hunters" got a ton of upvotes prior to Legion's announcement, how do we handle that? Do we dodge the question (which says just as much as answering it)? Do we lie and say we have no such plans? There really isn't a good outcome there.<br><br>
		3) It's pretty easily abused - if I want my question to be answered, it makes sense for me to ask all of my friends/guildmates/etc to upvote my question and downvote others, even if they don't care about the answer.<br><br>
		4) It heavily favors playstyles or classes with the highest overall representation; it's likely for there to be entire aspects of the game we never talk about again just because there are going to be fewer people upvoting those questions.<br><br>
		Because of the above (and probably a couple other reasons I can't recall right now), we decided that our best approach was to just ignore upvotes/downvotes entirely.
	</p>

	<p>
		<span style="color:#ffffff;"><em>Yes, not only is it acceptable to say, 'We don't know," or "We aren't sure yet," but that kind of transparency is absolutely necessary for quality feedback and communication. Those are great jumping off points to get good feedback from the community. Of course, hopefully you would give us more than just those statements. Hopefully, you would explain why you haven't been able to come to a decision yet, what you perceive to be the pros and cons, and why it is so difficult to make that particular call and then MAYBE the community could help you actually make the decision. <br><br>
		Even if our feedback won't help make the decision easier, understanding your thought process will make it easier to accept the decision once it is made.</em></span>
	</p>

	<p>
		To be clear: I agree that "we don't know yet" can be a good thing to say. I don't think a time-limited Q&amp;A is the right place to do that - would rather spend that time on a question we actually have an answer for.

	World First Helya killers Method talk bans, bosses, Nighthold preparations and more.
</p>

<p>
	<br>
	In addition to their earlier FinalBoss video interview, Method have posted <a href="http://www.method.gg/valor-proven-a-method-post-tov-interview" rel="external nofollow">a new, written one on their site</a>, covering the specifics of the Trial of Valor race, their thoughts on the bans, the bosses and their preparations for Nighthold. You can check out the full interview over at <a href="http://www.method.gg/valor-proven-a-method-post-tov-interview" rel="external nofollow">Method.gg</a>, and here are a few highlights:
</p>

<p>
	<span style="color: #ff9900;">You’re back on top, World First again, how does it feel and was it even important to you in ToV, considering the comments made prior to the raid?</span><br><br><a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/character/tarren-mill/Nnoggah/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Nnogga</a>: For various members of the guild this was the first time to achieve a World First Kill on an endboss and I think it is safe to say that it feels absolutely amazing to have pulled it off. There were a lot of naysayers that doubted our capabilities as a guild on public forums or social media but the core of the guild has been playing together for a long time now and we knew that with hard preparation and good planning we could definitely compete for World First. As soon as we realized that Helya actually was a difficult encounter I think everyone went back into "serious mode" and we wanted to get this kill really badly.<br><br><span style="color: #ff9900;">As Xavius was a horrible disappointment and not worthy of even being mentioned in the same breath as other raid endbosses, where would you place Helya in the endboss pantheon?</span><br><br><a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/character/tarren-mill/Scogun/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Sco</a>: Helya is a great fight and I rate it pretty highly. In terms of difficulty it took 225 pulls which I would say is about mid-tier difficulty in regards to end bosses. The important aspect though is that the fight itself was both fun and engaging. The fight requires a lot of movement, a lot of coordination and a lot of team work. I will remember it fondly and as far as Legion goes it is the best boss I’ve played thus far – including those we have tested in Nighthold. Let’s hope Gul’Dan is something special!<br><br><span style="color: #ff9900;">What are your thoughts on the bans in general, do you think they were too harsh, should Blizzard have been more clear about not using the bug or have done something else differently?</span><br><br><a href="http://eu.battle.net/wow/character/tarren-mill/Qooning/" rel="external nofollow" target="_blank">Qoning</a>: Considering Blizzard knew about the bug at least since the day Mythic opened, I think they were pretty harsh. They could have removed their achievements, give them a 3 day ban, call it a day. And to be nice to them, reset their IDs. I don't think the reaction was in line with what Blizzard has done ever in the past. On the other hand, it was all kinds of shady from the guilds to use obvious exploits when competing for ranks. I understand that it may have been a part of their strategy to sacrifice a tank on some of the breaths and this exploit basically meant that you could not do that at all, but abusing it made the encounter significantly easier.

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	Spring Balloon Festival is the next micro-holiday that's currently tested on PTR. It will be available on May 8.
</p>

<p>
	There are eight places where you can take a balloon ride in Azeroth. Four are located across the Broken Isles. They are indicated by a red "X" on the world map.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="nDw2raA.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/nDw2raA.jpg"></p>

<p>
	The balloons have cool names. For example the one in Highmountain is called <a class="npc" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/118446" rel="external nofollow">The Killem'jaro</a>. If you want to get a ride, you need to talk to a NPC located near the balloon. A total of 3 players is needed to begin the ride.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="941a7AL.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/941a7AL.jpg"></p>

<p>
	The balloon ride above Suramar City is truly educational. <a class="npc" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/118357" rel="external nofollow">Zang Cloudwalker</a> will first be taking attendance and then ask questions related to the Nightborne.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="4Qq6AvV.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/4Qq6AvV.jpg"></p>

<p>
	<em>What is the traditional greeting used in Suramar City? Good guess! The correct answer is: "An illusion! What are you hiding?".</em>
</p>

<p>
	A hobgoblin named <a class="npc" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/118468" rel="external nofollow">Rungle</a> and the goblin <a class="npc" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/118351" rel="external nofollow">Boscoe</a> will be waiting for you in Azsuna.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="FnrARrm.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/FnrARrm.jpg"></p>

<p>
	In Highmountain, you need to talk to <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/94409" rel="external nofollow">Hemet Nesingwary</a> to queue for a ride.
</p>

<p>
	<img alt="tsc9jmt.jpg" class="ipsImage" src="http://i.imgur.com/tsc9jmt.jpg"></p>

<p>
	There's even a balloon ride, where you need to throw a goblin out of the balloon. The NPC is called <a class="npc" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/118340" rel="external nofollow">Balloon Commander Schnottz</a> and the spell is <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Schnottz Has To Go" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/achievement_goblinheaddead.jpg"><a class="spell" href="http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/236346" rel="external nofollow">Schnottz Has To Go</a></span>.

	<strong>Update</strong>: Apparently this is not the world first. Chinese guilds were able to clear M+ 20 <a href="https://www.wowchina.com/zh-cn/game/pve/leaderboards/pandaren/vault-of-the-wardens" rel="external nofollow">a few days earlier</a>.
</p>

<p>
	The run was tanked by Lazel and healed by Gamko. DPS were Fragnance, Deepshades, Gingi. Congratulations!

<p data-icy-veins="news_description">
	Winter Veil is coming to Azeroth on December 16 and it's an opportunity to make some extra gold.
</p>

<p>
	The best thing is you can be of any level to earn gold. The item of interest is <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Small Egg" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_egg_01.jpg"><a class="q1" href="http://www.wowdb.com/items/6889" rel="external nofollow">Small Egg</a></span>. Why? Most players need eggs to create <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Winter Veil Egg Nog" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_drink_04.jpg"><a class="spell" href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/21144" rel="external nofollow">Winter Veil Egg Nog</a></span> and <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Gingerbread Cookie" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_misc_food_62.jpg"><a class="spell" href="http://www.wowdb.com/spells/21143" rel="external nofollow">Gingerbread Cookie</a></span> to complete <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="The Winter Veil Gourmet" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/inv_misc_food_62.jpg"><a class="achievement" href="http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1688" rel="external nofollow">The Winter Veil Gourmet</a></span> for the <span class="spell_icon_span"><img alt="Merrymaker" class="spell_icon" src="http://static.icy-veins.com/forum-links/icons/achievement_worldevent_merrymaker.jpg"><a class="achievement" href="http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/1691" rel="external nofollow">Merrymaker</a></span> meta of Winter Veil.
</p>

<p>
	Ridiculous farming spots are in Westfall, you will get a lot of eggs by killing <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/154" rel="external nofollow">Greater Fleshrippers</a> as they have almost instant respawn. If you're playing Horde, you can kill <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/15649" rel="external nofollow">Feral Dragonhawk Hatchling</a> just outside of Silvermoon City or <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/15650" rel="external nofollow">Crazed Dragonhawk</a> in Eversong Woods. If you're playing a Tauren, you can find <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/2971" rel="external nofollow">Taloned Swoop</a> in northern Mulgore. If you're Draenei, there's a lot of <a class="npc" href="http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/17372" rel="external nofollow">Timberstrider Fledglings</a> in Azuremyst Isle. 
</p>
